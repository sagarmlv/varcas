                Installation of Screwed Fittings:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Installing Screwed Fittings involves threading the pipes into the fittings manually or using a wrench to ensure a tight and secure connection. Proper alignment and tightening are essential to prevent leaks and ensure the integrity of the piping system. Thread sealants or tape may be used to enhance the sealing properties of the threaded connections.
