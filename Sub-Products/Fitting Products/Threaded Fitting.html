                Design and Structure of Threaded Fittings:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Threaded Fittings are typically constructed from durable materials such as stainless steel, carbon steel, or brass. They feature threaded ends that allow them to be screwed onto corresponding pipes or fittings, creating a secure and leak-resistant connection. Threaded Fittings come in various shapes and sizes to accommodate different piping requirements.

                Types of Threaded Fittings:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Threaded Fittings are available in a wide range of types, including elbows, tees, couplings, unions, plugs, and caps, among others. Each type serves a specific purpose in piping systems, such as changing the direction of flow, branching off pipelines, or closing off pipe ends.

                Installation of Threaded Fittings:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Installing Threaded Fittings involves simply screwing them onto the threaded ends of pipes or other fittings using a compatible thread sealant or tape to ensure a tight seal. Care must be taken to avoid over-tightening, which can damage the threads or cause leaks. Proper alignment and sealing techniques are essential for reliable performance.
