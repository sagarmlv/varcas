                Design and Structure of Bolt Fasteners:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bolt Fasteners typically consist of a threaded rod with a head on one end and a nut on the other. The rod's diameter, length, and thread pitch vary depending on the application requirements and the loads it needs to withstand. They are available in various materials such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and alloy steel, chosen based on factors like corrosion resistance and mechanical properties.

                Types of Bolt Fasteners:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bolt Fasteners come in a variety of types, each designed for specific applications and load-bearing requirements. Common types include hex bolts, carriage bolts, eye bolts, and stud bolts. They may feature different head shapes and drive types, such as hexagonal heads, square heads, or slotted heads, to facilitate installation and removal.

                Installation of Bolt Fasteners:
            </h2>
            <p>
                Installing Bolt Fasteners involves inserting the threaded end through pre-drilled holes in the components to be joined and securing them with nuts tightened using wrenches or other suitable tools. Proper torqueing techniques are essential to ensure adequate clamping force and prevent over-tightening, which can lead to thread stripping or bolt failure.
